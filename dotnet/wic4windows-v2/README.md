This port is mostly intended to be deployed on Windows based cells when you might want to test for any connectivity issues.   Theoretically Linux and Windows Cells should be in the same network and have access to the same network resources.

Recommend that the project be built on a Windows machine and target .NET framework although supports .NET Core as well.
